# Task description
For this task, a Real-time Chat Application was developed using React.js for the frontend. The main goal of the project was to create a simple, clean, and responsive messaging interface that enables users to send and receive messages instantly. The application allows users to enter a name before joining the chat, send messages and view live message history, which updates in real-time without the need to to reload the page. This creates a smooth and interactive user experience that mirrors real-time communication, similar to widely used chat platforms.

The frontend was developed using React,HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the interface.The interface includes a heading, a username entry screen, a scrollable chat window to display messages, and an input form to send new messages. Each message is styled clearly and appears in chronological order, offering a smooth chat flow.
WebSocket connections enable real-time, two-way communication between the client and server. Messages sent from any user are instantly broadcast to all connected clients. To test this functionality, the application was opened in two different browser tabs with separate usernames. When one user sent a message, it appeared instantly in both chat windows, demonstrating the real-time nature of the system.

The project is divided into two main folders: the client folder, which contains the frontend React application, and the server folder, which holds the backend server. The node_modules folders are excluded from the submitted zipped version for size and simplicity, but can easily be restored by running npm install inside both the client and server directories.
This project serves as a foundation for understanding how real-time communication works in modern web applications. It also offers flexibility for future expansion, such as adding chat rooms, one-to-one user texting or integrating with a database to save chat history. The chats can even be displayed with the timme sent, like in popular messaging platforms like whatsapp.

This project demonstrates the working of real-time communication systems in a simple and modular way, making it easy to expand in the future. This project can be used for things like live customer support, asking questions during events or classes, team chats at work, messaging in games, or chatting inside a private group or company.
